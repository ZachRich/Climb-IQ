            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              You're three weeks into a new training program and instead of getting stronger, you <em>"feel weaker and get fatigued fast."</em> Every session feels harder than the last, and you're starting to wonder if something's wrong with you.

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-destructive">The Overtraining Spiral</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              You're <em>"absolutely overworking your body"</em> but don't know how to fix it. You climb 3+ hours, 3 days a week, following programs designed by pros, yet you <em>"don't feel any progress, only regression."</em>

            <h3 className="text-xl font-bold mb-4 text-destructive">The Motivation Killer</h3>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              You're <em>"starting to feel more and more demotivated"</em> because your climbing seems to be getting worse despite your dedication. You question whether you should push through or quit entirely.

            <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              You're not weak, lazy, or lacking talent. Generic training programs can't account for your unique recovery patterns, life stress, sleep quality, or daily readiness. What works for someone else might be <strong className="text-foreground">completely wrong for your body today.</strong>
